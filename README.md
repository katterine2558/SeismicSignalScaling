Signal Processing and DEEPSOIL Results Compiler

This project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool developed using CustomTkinter and Selenium for automating signal processing and compiling DEEPSOIL results. The tool ensures that only authorized devices can execute the application by verifying MAC addresses.

üìÇ Project Structure

    main.py
    The main script that launches the GUI, verifies MAC addresses, processes seismic signals, and compiles DEEPSOIL outputs.

    prueba.py
    Script for verifying authorized MAC addresses and displaying a basic GUI for authorized users.

    Icons and Images:
        logo.ico: Application icon.
        error.ico: Error icon.
        exito.ico: Success icon.
        progreso.ico: Progress icon.
        icono_escalar.png: Icon for scaling signals.
        icono_postprocesar.png: Icon for compiling DEEPSOIL results.

    requirements.txt
    Dependencies required for the project.
